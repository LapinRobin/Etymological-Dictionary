# Etymological-Dictionary

## Project description
The dictionary is organized in a collection of individual Markdown files, each representing a specific word. The files are named after the word they represent, making it easy to navigate and find the information you need. 

The content has three sections:
- Etymology: The etymology section delves into the word's origin and its historical development. It traces the word back to its roots in various languages, such as Old English, Latin, Greek, or other ancestral languages.
- Definition: This section provides detailed definitions of the word in all parts of speech. Each definition is numbered for easy reference.
- Synonyms: The synonyms section lists alternative words that have similar meanings or can be used interchangeably with the word in question.

## How to use

1. Unzip the file `Etymological-dictionary.zip` and open the folder with Obsidian, a software application that works on local Markdown files. 
2. Open graph view (`Ctrl + G` on Windows, `Command + G` on Mac) to see the connection between words. 
3. To investigate detailed information of a word, click on the node.

## Tools used

The files are generated using Python script. Web scraping was done by using the package BeautifulSoup.
